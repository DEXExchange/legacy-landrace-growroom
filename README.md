The top 9 legacy landrace strains grown from the foothills of the Himalayas to the hallowed grounds of the impossible city, Tenochtitlan 

This source code is the UX/UI front-end of the CCG DApp “Legacy Landrace Strain Grow Room” which is actually a Decentralized App powered by Tron Smart Contracts.

Here each digital plant is a TRC20 and obtainable strain varieties in the CCG DApp ecosystem are vied for by users and participants. 

These varieties are obtained through the 2 base utility tokens SativaGeneSeed and or IndicaGeneSeed, along with a host of partnering TRC10s such as LeafUp (LEAF) and EMSToken (EMS). The game ranks CCG DApp players based on how fast they are at climbing up breeding  leaderboards. The top breeders aim to minimize contract grow times (based on real cryptographic time-locks) to zero and can also bet and earn bonuses for unearthing rare genes.

All grow-rooms are scaled from this original genesis Legacy Landrace Strain smart contract.
